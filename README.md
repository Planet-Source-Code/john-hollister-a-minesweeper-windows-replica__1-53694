### Description

this is pretty close to the windows version. it pretty much has all the features, i think. it even employs the little-known double click clear that most of the minesweepers on psc seem to lack. i don't think there are any bugs left. the code pretty basic. i use bitblt and some recursion and simple file I/O. let me know what you think. thanks
